# Excuse me, what's going on here?

You can safely ignore this, this is just a test post to make sure everything is working.

## Wait, how does this work?

I'm using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) to generate this site, which uses [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) to parse Markdown into these static blog pages. It all lives on [a public GitHub repository over here](https://github.com/msnidal/blog), which is then fed through a series of tubes referred to as "GitHub Pages" and then served over the internet. This is all, of course, not to be confused with an actual pelican:

## Ok, great. What's next?

I'm going to start writing about some of the projects I've been working on, and some of the things I've learned along the way. I'm also going to start writing about some of the things I'm interested in, and some of the things I'm learning! We'll see how it goes.
