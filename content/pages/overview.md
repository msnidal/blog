Hello there! I'm a software and data platform engineer, currently working at [Connectly](https://connectly.ai) where I am building our data platform and ecommerce LLM chatbot. I'm interested in scaling data infrastructure and applying large language models to all kinds of problems. I have recently contributed to:

- [terraform-provider-pinecone](https://github.com/biosugar0/terraform-provider-pinecone) (go): Added support for [metadata field indexing](https://github.com/biosugar0/terraform-provider-pinecone/pull/24) to the Terraform provider for the Pinecone vector search database
- [dspy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) (python): Fixed and overhauled the [Pinecone retrieval module](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/pull/148) for dspy, a LLM prompting framework project from the Stanford NLP group
- [fastapi-profiler](https://github.com/sunhailin-Leo/fastapi_profiler) (python): Implemented [standard `.prof` profiling](https://github.com/sunhailin-Leo/fastapi_profiler/pull/13) file support for a FastAPI middleware profiling tool
- [gpt-review](https://github.com/microsoft/gpt-review) (python): Added support for [calling the OpenAI API directly](https://github.com/microsoft/gpt-review/pull/85) where previously only Azure was implemented on this GitHub pull request GPT generation tool by Microsoft
- [feast](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast) (python): Fixed some errors relating to [PostgreSQL types](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/pull/3634) for the Feast ML feature store (mainly so I could use it at work, lol)

I have also written:

- [Stitch ETL dagster integration](https://github.com/msnidal/dagster-stitch)
- [attercop, a command-line GPT shell tool](https://github.com/msnidal/attercop)

I've worked in startups in Canada and the US, after doing some internships in the video game and aerospace industry and getting my software engineering degree from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/software-engineering.html) in Montreal:

- [Dataperformers](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dataperformers) (2018-2020): Joined a small bootstrapped Montreal-based team of machine learning researchers as a cloud architect and data engineer out of school, applying my software engineering background to help deliver machine learning projects for various local clients
- [Breather](https://breather.com) (2020-2021): Took over the data stack and built out our Luigi DAGs and dbt models as well as some machine learning projects including a dynamic occupancy prediction model through what turned out to be a pretty tumultous Covid ride in the workspace industry
- [Industrious](https://industriousoffice.com) (2021-2023): Breather was [acquired by Industrious](https://www.industriousoffice.com/blog/industrious/industrious-acquires-key-assets-of-on-demand-workspace-platform-breather). On joining the Industrious data team I led the development of a new data warehouse consisting of hundreds of new data models models including all the revenue modelling and forecasting for the company
- [Connectly](https://connectly.ai) (2023-present): Developing pipelines and features for our AI chatbot and data platform in Python, Go, SQL, and Terraform
