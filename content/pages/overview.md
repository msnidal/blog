# Intro

Hello! I'm a data and software engineer, currently leading data engineering at [Connectly](https://connectly.ai), where I build our data platform and ship features for our ecommerce chatbot. I'm interested in scaling data infrastructure and applying large language models to all kinds of problems.

Through my career I've been working in various fast-paced startups based in Canada and the US, after doing some internships in the video game and aerospace industry and getting my software engineering degree from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/software-engineering.html) in Montreal:

- [Dataperformers](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dataperformers) (Montreal, Canada, 2018-2020): Joined a small bootstrapped team of machine learning researchers as a cloud architect and data engineer out of school, bringing my software engineering background to deliver on machine learning projects for various clients
- [Breather](https://breather.com) (Montreal, Canada, 2020-2021): Took over the data stack and built out our Luigi DAGs and dbt models as well as some machine learning projects including a dynamic occupancy prediction model through a tumultous Covid ride
- [Industrious](https://industriousoffice.com) (New York, USA, 2021-2023): Breather was [acquired by Industrious](https://www.industriousoffice.com/blog/industrious/industrious-acquires-key-assets-of-on-demand-workspace-platform-breather), upon which I joined the data team and built out a new data warehouse consisting of hundreds of new dbt models including all the revenue modelling and forecasting for the company
- [Connectly](https://connectly.ai) (San Francisco, USA, 2023-present): Joined our engineering team where I split my time between data and software engineering in Python, Go and SQL, shipping features and data pipelines for our ecommerce LLM chatbot as well as our data platform more broadly

Aside from my day job, you may be interested in some contributions I've made to open source projects recently (as of 2023):

- [terraform-provider-pinecone](https://github.com/biosugar0/terraform-provider-pinecone) (go): Added support for [metadata field indexing](https://github.com/biosugar0/terraform-provider-pinecone/pull/24) to the Terraform provider for Pinecone, a vector search engine (which I use at work)
- [dspy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) (python): Overhauled the [Pinecone retrieval module](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/pull/148) for dspy, a language model prompting framework
- [fastapi-profiler](https://github.com/sunhailin-Leo/fastapi_profiler) (python): Implemented [standard `.prof` profiling](https://github.com/sunhailin-Leo/fastapi_profiler/pull/13) file support for a FastAPI middleware library
- [gpt-review](https://github.com/microsoft/gpt-review) (python): Added support for [calling the OpenAI API directly](https://github.com/microsoft/gpt-review/pull/85) where previously only Azure was implemented on this GitHub GPT pull request generation tool
- [feast](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast) (python): Fixed some errors relating to [PostgreSQL types](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/pull/3634) for the Feast feature store (also so I could use it at work)

As standalone projects I have built a [Stitch ETL integration for Dagster](https://github.com/msnidal/dagster-stitch), a cloud orchestration framework, as well as [attercop, a command-line GPT shell tool](https://github.com/msnidal/attercop). I'm reachable by [email](mailto:mark.snidal@gmail.com) or over on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/marksnidal/).
